The old hund was driving his porsche along the Hauptstrasse when he spotted a Biergarten near the walk.
He started to salivate when he saw that it served Doener.
So the hund pulled over, and the scents overtook him; Doener, Bratwurst, Apfelkuchen. "I must have them all!", he thought.
The old hund was enthralled with his Bratwurst with a bun fresh from a Baeckerei.
Since the Biergarten did not have Klimaanlage, he decided to order a drink.
